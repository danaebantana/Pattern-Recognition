Prediction of Football Match Results Using Machine Learning Algorithms

## About
Constructed two programs which use the ‘Least Mean Square’ and ‘Least Square’ Algorithms to predict the outcome of a football match. Also with the use of the 'MLPClassifier', we constructed a multi-layer Neural Network. The 10-fold cross validation method is implemented on each classifier and the classification accuracy is recorded for each fold of each classifier.  

## Key Components
1. Data Folder: Contains the data from the database https://www.kaggle.com/hugomathien/soccer.
2. Data.py: Responsible for the data management of all the inquiries of the project.
3. Functions.py: Consists of all the necessary functions for the 'Least Mean Square' and 'Least Square' Algorithms and the multi-layer NN.
4. LeastMeanSquares.py: Implements the 'Least Mean Square' algorthm for the prediction of the outcome of a football match. 
5. LeastSquares.py: Implements the 'Least Square' algorthm for the prediction of the outcome of a football match. 
6. MLP.py: A multi-layer Perceptron is created and trained for the purpose of predicting the outcome of a football match.

## Technologies
Project is created with:
* Spyder 4.2.5 through the Anaconda Distribution
* Python 3.8.8
